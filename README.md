# Amazon-Fashion-Discovery-engine
On real time Amazon Dataset, designed the system to generate recommendations based on text-semantics similarity and visual similarity.  
TF-IDF weighted Word2Vec were used for text modelling and ConvNets to featurize image to edges, shape and parts.
Nearest Neighbour similarity were used to generate final recommendations and A/B testing was used to evaluate effectiveness of our solution.
